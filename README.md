# Home Assistant support for Tuya BLE devices

## Overview

This integration is an almalgamation of a number of community maintained forks. It should be considered **unstable** quality at this time.

See full list of forks:
https://github.com/ha-tuya-ble/ha_tuya_ble/issues/1


_Inspired by code of [@redphx](https://github.com/redphx/poc-tuya-ble-fingerbot) & forked from https://github.com/PlusPlus-ua/ha_tuya_ble_ 

_Original HASS component forked from https://github.com/PlusPlus-ua/ha_tuya_ble_

_This forks base is from https://github.com/markusg1234/ha_tuya_ble_


## Installation

Place the `custom_components` folder in your configuration directory (or add its contents to an existing `custom_components` folder). Alternatively install via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ha-tuya-ble&repository=ha_tuya_ble&category=integration)

## Usage

After adding to Home Assistant integration should discover all supported Bluetooth devices, or you can add discoverable devices manually.

The integration works locally, but connection to Tuya BLE device requires device ID and encryption key from Tuya IOT cloud. It could be obtained using the same credentials as in the previous official Tuya integration. To obtain the credentials, please refer to official Tuya integration [documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20231228044831/https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tuya/) [[1]](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/blob/a4e6d4819f1db584cc66ba2082508d3978f83f7e/source/_integrations/tuya.markdown)

## Note that the original hasn't been updated in a long time, still, Support original developer @PlusPlus-ua:

I am working on this integration in Ukraine. Our country was subjected to brutal aggression by Russia. The war still continues. The capital of Ukraine - Kyiv, where I live, and many other cities and villages are constantly under threat of rocket attacks. Our air defense forces are doing wonders, but they also need support. So if you want to help the development of this integration, donate some money and I will spend it to support our air defense.

## Tuya BLE — PLD_P130 Smart Lock Integration

### New Device Support
- Added **Pulido PLD_P130 Smart Lever Lock** (`0qxp5u7s`) to the `ms` category

### Files Changed

#### `__init__.py`
- Added BLE adapter readiness check on startup using `bluetooth.async_scanner_count()`
- Replaced fire-and-forget `hass.add_job(device.update())` and commented-out dead code with a proper 3-attempt retry loop (5 second delay between attempts)
- Raises `ConfigEntryNotReady` on failure so HA automatically retries the config entry setup

#### `devices.py`
- Added `TuyaBLESmartLockInfo` dataclass for future locks requiring explicit DP id mapping
- Added `smartlock` field to `TuyaBLEProductInfo`
- Added `0qxp5u7s` as `"Pulido PLD_P130 Smart Lever Lock"`

#### `lock.py`
- Added `TuyaBLESmartLock` entity class driven by `TuyaBLESmartLockInfo` for future use
- Legacy `TuyaBLELock` class preserved unchanged

#### `button.py`
- Added `0qxp5u7s` to the `ms` bluetooth unlock button mapping (DP 6)

#### `select.py`
- Excluded `0qxp5u7s` from the `ms` `beep_volume` group (DP 31) — confirmed not supported on the P130

#### `sensor.py`
- Added dedicated sensor mapping for `0qxp5u7s`:
  - DP 8 — battery (`residual_electricity`)
  - DP 21 — alarm lock state
  - DP 12 — fingerprint unlock
  - DP 19 — BLE unlock event counter
- Excluded door sensor (DP 40) which is not present on the P130

#### `switch.py`
- Added dedicated switch mapping for `0qxp5u7s`:
  - DP 46 — manual lock
  - DP 47 — motor state
  - DP 33 — free passage mode (direct logic, on = on)

#### `strings.json`
- Added `"Free Passage Mode"` display name

#### `translations/en.json`
- Added `"Free Passage Mode"` display name

### Notes
- DP 31 (`beep_volume`) is **not supported** on the P130 — confirmed by testing
- DP 33 is labelled `automatic_lock` in Tuya's cloud but functions as **Free Passage Mode** on this device — when on, the lock holds open; when off, normal operation resumes
- DP 32 (`reverse_lock`) is present on the device per Tuya cloud diagnostics but not yet mapped
