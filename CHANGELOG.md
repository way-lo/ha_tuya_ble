### Breaking change
* Fix entity ID wrong domain issue by @CloCkWeRX in https://github.com/ha-tuya-ble/ha_tuya_ble/pull/193

  Previously, a bug generated the entity_ids all in the sensor domain. This has now been corrected, but means all existing entity ids will be regenerated in the correct domain on upgrade; ie "button.xyz"

  If you have automations that rely on specific entity ids; ensure you plan out time to migrate.
