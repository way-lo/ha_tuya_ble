### Adding a new device

When adding a new device, do not add tests just for the mapping.
Only add test coverage if there are changes to the behaviour of any of the existing platforms, bluetooth communication, or unique details beyond a simple mapping.

When adding a new device, ensure that strings are translated.

### Commits

Ensure that
* `black` is run
* JSON is well formatted, valid and consistent with existing conventions
* Commit messages follow Conventional Commits style. As new devices are common, use "fix:" when adding a basic mapping
