# Contributing Guide

This guide is for when:

- I have a new device that isn't supported.
- I have a similar device to one that is already supported.

What could go wrong?

This guide explains how to generate a new PR for a set of **DPIDs** (Device Property IDs) using **Google Jules (Web UI)**, and how to collect the DPIDs from [Tuya IoT](https://iot.tuya.com).

---

### 1. Prerequisites

- Access to [Tuya IoT Platform](https://iot.tuya.com/) with a developer account.  
- Access to **Google Jules** in your browser (with permissions to create PRs on this repo).

---

### 2. Getting DPIDs from Tuya IoT

1. **Log in** to [Tuya IoT](https://iot.tuya.com/).  
2. Go to **Cloud → Development → Devices**.  
3. Select the device you want to support or update.  
4. Open the **Functions (DP)** tab.  
5. Copy the list of **DPIDs** and their descriptions (or the JSON!)

   Example:
   ```text
   DPID 1 → Switch (Boolean)
   DPID 2 → Brightness (Integer, 0–1000)
   DPID 3 → Mode (Enum: white, colour, scene)
   ```
6. Whangjangle this into google jules, claude or your preferred agent:

```
Add support for Example Product - SmartLife Finger Robot (category: szjqr - Product ID: yn4x5fa7)
Add the product details, id to the README.
Ensure that you have installed `black` and it is run before commit.
Ensure that any JSON modifications are well formed.

{ "result": { "category": "szjqr", "functions": [ { "code": "switch", "dp_id": 1, "type": "Boolean", "values": "{}" }, { "code": "mode", "dp_id": 2, "type": "Enum", "values": "{"range":["click"]}" }, { "code": "click_sustain_time", "dp_id": 3, "type": "Integer", "values": "{"unit":"0.1s","min":3,"max":100,"scale":1,"step":1}" }
```


7. Publish PR, clearly indicate it is AI assisted if it is not obvious. You should end up with something like https://github.com/ha-tuya-ble/ha_tuya_ble/pull/78
8. Test locally and iterate - add your fork via https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/
9. Share your test results - screenshots or didn't happen is a good rule of thumb!

## I am struggling, what are my options?

Raise an issue with the same information as above.
Search github for your product ID, others may have implemented a fix in a different fork. If found, please mention in issue so fork can be integrated.
